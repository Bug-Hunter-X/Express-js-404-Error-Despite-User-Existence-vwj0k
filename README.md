# Express.js 404 Error Despite User Existence

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications where a 404 (Not Found) error is thrown even when the requested resource exists.  The issue stems from improper error handling within the route handler.

## Bug Description

The provided `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route that fetches user data based on an ID.  If the user is not found, a 404 error is sent. However, even if the user exists,  a 404 error is incorrectly returned due to a flaw in the error handling logic. This occurs because the error handling is missing a crucial part and sends a 404 even when the user is found and the application crashes due to the lack of error handling.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to correct this problem.  Robust error handling ensures that the application responds appropriately in various situations, preventing unexpected 404 errors.
